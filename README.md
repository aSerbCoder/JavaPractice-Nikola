# Java Practice for Nikola

# How to Start

1. Clone the repository

   - Remember `git clone ...`

2. Create branch and go into it

   - `git checkout -b my_attempt`

3. Open the directory

   - `cd` into "devic-learn-java"

4. Find the file `Exercise_001.java` in _Exercises_

5. Follow exercise

6. Run `Main.java` to test your program

# Few Things to Remember

1. Commit after finishing every exercise

   **FOR EXAMPLE**

   - `git commit -m "finished 001`

2. If there is a link in the big message at the beginning of the exercise, please follow it and read what I wanted you to read

3) DO NOT LOOK AT KEY, ASK ME FOR HELP

   - The key is only there to test your output with the correct output.
